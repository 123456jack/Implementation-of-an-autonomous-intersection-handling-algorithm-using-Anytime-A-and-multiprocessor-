# Implementation-of-an-autonomous-intersection-handling-algorithm-using-Anytime-A-and-multiprocessor-
This repository contains my code for implementing a python algorithm for an autonomous car to plan around an intersection while negotiating around dynamic and static obstacles
The algorithm is explained in the report and presentation which can be found in the folder named 'src'
